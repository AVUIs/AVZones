You will need soundfiles and add their names to Playlist.cpp
https://github.com/AVUIs/AVZones/blob/master/Playlist.cpp

The files I am currently using are from http://www.freesound.org. In Freesound, you can find the same files by searching the file (number in the beggining of file name, or title). Thank you to the Freesound community.
